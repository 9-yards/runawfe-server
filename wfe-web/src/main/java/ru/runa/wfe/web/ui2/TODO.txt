TODO Query string for JSP ???
TODO Hash in hash (for tab controls) ???
TODO Error page (#spa-error): main menu, server-side error logger + localized "server-side error NNNN" message, links "Retry" & "Go home" ???
    Server-side error logging first requires cleaning exception subclasses mess.
TODO Localization.
    Server-side templates, I suppose.
TODO IE.
TODO Wiki, including:
    Restrictions on HTML pages and JS files: only title and links to JS / CSS files is accepted; body[onload].
    How it works: cumulative JS & CSS into main body.
    For speed and low traffic, don't user browser's refresh unless re-login.
    onLoad() must call wfe.wait() if it does ajax request(s), and always must call wfe.ready() (or wfe.error() if ajax fails)
        because wfe.wait() is called by SPA on first page access without subsequent wfe.ready().
        This is done in wfe.ajaxGetJson() helper.
TODO Authentication: currently done by old site, currentUser is rendered on server-side in JSP.
TODO Move to REST API.
    But first, what about REST Authentication?
    Path-encoded vars in Struts actions?
    Then, current UI2 API requests should accept requested columns list (along with pagination, etc.)
        On server side, this column list is best mapped to SQL column list, to minimize java-sql traffic too.
TODO Should generate JSON without RAM usage, in a style of Apache wink-json4j.
    But first, this requires:
    1. Move to SQL (or upgrade Hibernate so it can return DB cursors instead of entity lists).
    2. Get rid of EjbTransactionalIntercetor in favour or Spring's @Transactional.
    3. Make web methods returning large JSONs (entity lists) @Transactional so open DB cursors may be passed to them.
